## Introduction

We aim to provide an easier way for people to access services that require waiting for their turn. With the current situation of the pandemic, it becomes essential to provide a way for people to maintain social distancing in everyday life. With essential everyday necessities including groceries or withdrawing money from the bank, that require people to wait in queues, our product provides a platform for the service giver to create a virtual queue which people can join, without physically rushing into a line. This way, the crowd outside their store/centre can be dismissed as people can wait away and avail the service once our app shows them their turn...
